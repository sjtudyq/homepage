                                I am a senior year undergraduate in Computer Science <a href="http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>.

                                My research interests lie in the combining area of <span class="emphasis">Algorithms, Theory</span> and <span class="emphasis">Machine Learning</span>. I did some projects on Machine Learning and got some practical results. However, I'd more like to know why it works, instead of tuning models to just make it work. So I want to research on theoretical aspects and algorithms, and try to explain the inner mechanism of machine learning systems. I do believe, only by understanding the mathematical principles, one can build more reliable machine learning systems.

									We summarized the non-iid data partition in previous works, and added more data partition methods based on project FedMA. We are currently running a benchmark for different non-iid scenario using FedAvg algorithm. The algorithm fails in extreme non-iid case (e.g. each party only contains one category of data). Still on progress to solve this problem.

									This study uses various methods to classify the severity of carotid artery. We revised the Augmented Neural Ode Net for this medical task and slightly improved the accuracy to ~80%. With some domain knowledge, we know the data contains much noise and probably fail to yield accuracy above 90% (which could be put in practical use then). Details can be found in this <a href="https://scai.confex.com/scai/2020/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/11034" "="">abstract</a>. How much test accuracy can we achieve on a data set? Is our model complex enough? These are all open questions.

									This study aims to use new structures to extract 3D mesh information. Meshes are stored in graph structure. It is still an open question how to effectively extract features in graph. We published a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05079">paper</a> to recover 3D hand mesh from RGB image, as an application for robotics.
